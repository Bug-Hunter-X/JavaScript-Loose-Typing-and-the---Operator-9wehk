This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript pitfall: unexpected behavior from the + operator due to loose typing. The `bug.js` file shows examples where adding numbers and strings leads to string concatenation instead of numerical addition. The `bugSolution.js` file offers solutions using type checking or the Number() function to ensure intended behavior.  This is a classic example of why careful type handling is crucial in JavaScript.
